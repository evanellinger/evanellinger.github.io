<h1><strong><CENTER>Four guys and a Trailer</CENTER></strong></h1>
<p>This past summer myself and three of my comrades embarked on a journey west heading toward Jackson Hole Wyoming. We had no idea what this adventure had in store for us but we were excited to find out. We left Georgia with no idea where we were going to live so our first mission upon arrival was to find shelter. We came to the conclusion that our best option would be to buy a trailer that we could all stay in. Once we got there we began our search for our new home. After a few homeless nights we had finally found the one. A 1999 Aljo skyline that we named Craig. Craig was not the nicest of trailers, but he was ours and we loved him dearly. After a week of living inside Craig, a problem arose. He began to leak during a thunderstorm. At first we did not think much of it, but the leaks began to multiply until it was uninhabitable. While we were not able to stop the leaks throughout the summer, we were able to control them enough to be able to live in it. </p>

     <h2><BIG>Leisure Sports Rafting Company</BIG></h2>
     <p>During the summer we worked at a store that specialized in whitewater rafting. We rented out rafts and kayaks to private parties who wanted to expeirance the plethora of whitewater rapids in the Snake river. In order to be of service to our customers we had to become knowledgable about whitewater rafting so we could answer any questions they might have. We not only had to meorizethe pricing of different kinds of equipment, but also learn what kinds of rafts were appropriate for different parts of the river. For example if a customer intended to go down a skinnier part of the river we needed to know to give them a raft that wasn't too wide. Below is a table of the rafts that we rented out this summer. </p>

         <h1><CENTER>Our Trip to Yellowstone National Park</CENTER></h1>
         <p>After a long summer of working, we decided to end our trip with a visit to nearby Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is one of the most visited attractions in the world and for good reason, it is 3471 square miles of pure beauty. Upon arrival at Yellowstone we stopped by the visitor center to map out a plan of how we could expeirance Yellowstone in only two days. We started off by visiting Old Faithful. Old Faithful is the largest and most famous geyser in all of Yellowstone. We waited for patiently for the geyser to erupt and once it finally did, it was truly breathtaking. Afterwards we went hiking in the northern part of the park. On our hike we saw wildlife such as bison, cattle, fox, and much more. The highlight of the trip, however, was seeing the "Grand Canyon of Yellowstone" which is a large canyon with a beautiful waterfall from the Yellowstone river. While it isn't the most famous part of Yellowstone it is a memory that I will never forget. My recollection of it does not do it justice, to learn more about The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone please visit the link below </p>
